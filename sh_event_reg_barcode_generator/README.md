About
============
Nowadays in the event, there are many attendees attend with fake tickets. That's why we build this module specially for event management. Using this module you can easily generate tickets with a barcode, we show the barcode in form view. So it will reduce the number of fraud attendees in the event. Also, you can print that ticket in PDF format.
